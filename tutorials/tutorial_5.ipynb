    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we extend our previous Actor-Critic (A2C) implementation to handle continuous action spaces. Instead of selecting from a set of discrete actions (e.g., left or right), our agent will choose from a continuous range of actions (e.g., a movement of $-0.23$ or $+0.12$). This flexibility allows us to model more realistic and complex environments.\n",
