    "## Actor-Critic Based Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we dive deeper into the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used in previous tutorials. We focus on the Actor-Critic method, which is a hybrid approach that combines ideas from value-based methods and policy-based methods. The actor network selects actions, while the critic network evaluates states, allowing the agent to learn both a policy and a value function simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actor:**  \n",
    "  Takes the current state as input and produces raw scores (logits) for each possible action. When these logits are passed through a softmax, they yield a probability distribution over actions. The actor is responsible for learning the policy that selects actions expected to yield high rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critic:**  \n",
    "  Evaluates the current state by outputting a single scalar value, representing the expected cumulative reward (or return) if the agent follows its policy from that state onward. This estimate is used as a baseline to compute the advantage, which guides the actor's updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is used in many state-of-the-art deep RL methods, because the critic’s evaluation stabilizes the policy updates by reducing variance in the gradient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Build an Actor-Critic neural network using PyTorch.\n",
    "- Create a custom policy with TD-learning.\n",
    "- Train and evaluate the agent in a Gymnasium environment (CartPole-v1)."

    "To start off one of the main differences between the SARSA algorithm in the last tutorial and the Actor-Critic model we'll be learning here is that the Actor-Critic architecture has **two specialized components that work in tandem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Actor Branch**  \n",
    "   - **Input:**         The current state.  \n",
    "   - **Output:**        Raw scores (logits) for each possible action.  \n",
    "   - **Processing:**    A softmax converts these logits into a probability distribution over actions.  \n",
    "   - **Role:**          Learns the policy by favoring actions that are likely to yield higher rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critic Branch**  \n",
    "   - **Input:**     The same state.  \n",
    "   - **Output:**    A single scalar value estimating the expected return (or state value).  \n",
    "   - **Role:**      Provides a baseline to compute the advantage, i.e., the difference between the actual returns and the estimated value, which guides the policy update.\n",
