    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated workspace that lets you maintain separate sets of packages for different projects. This isolation means that changes made in one environment do not affect others, which helps avoid conflicts between package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one project might need an older version of a library while another requires the latest version. Virtual environments allow you to work on both projects without interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also export a list of installed packages from a virtual environment to create a reproducible setup. This file can be shared, so others can recreate the same environment for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conda** is a popular package manager that simplifies creating and managing virtual environments. It lets you install, update, and remove packages, as well as easily switch between different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Pythonâ€™s default package manager, **pip**, conda includes a package solver that checks for compatibility between dependencies. This feature helps prevent conflicts and makes it simpler to install complex libraries that have many dependencies, including non-Python ones (for instance, libraries in C or C++). For example, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, which often rely on system-level libraries such as CUDA for GPU support, are easier to install and update with conda.\n",
